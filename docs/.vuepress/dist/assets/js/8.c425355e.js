days that they are moving from php and saying that php is dead and it is a mistake to learn it ðŸ˜¯ I said okay and i started to work with node and I've build a lot of projects such as login system,insta clone,youtube clone,etc. i was very comfortable with node i was thinking that it is the best thing. after a while just because of curiosity i started to play around with php and I've noticed that the amount of resources for php is at least 10x times more than node. and i remebered how much i struggled to find something in node when it is in every where for php. also according to stackoveflow there is 1.3 million questions for php and it is 350k for node so if you are struggling to find the solution of your problem in both It is more possible to find it for php. and it is the
