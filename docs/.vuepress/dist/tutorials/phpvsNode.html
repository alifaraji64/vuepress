node is the best choice when it comes to speed. but if your app dynamic like some sort of e-commerce or dashboard then php is for you. also there is another thing in node which is it's asynchronous or non-blocking nature this means in node when you are making a call instead of waiting for it to finish you can do other things while it is happening but in synchronous code like php when you are making a call you have to wail till it finishes and this feature in node makes it incredibily fast in compare to node.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong><span class="highlight">NODE</span></p> <h2 id="_4-job-market"><a href="#_4-job-market" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4-job market</h2> <p>according to indeed.com there are nearly 7000 jobs for php developers and for node.js it is 5000. as a freelance developer I can say that the job market for php is by far better than nodejs the main reason for that is content managment systems like wordpress and joomla. techjury.net over 30% of all websites over the world are built in wordpress ðŸ˜¬. so yeah there is no doubt that in 2021 the job market for php is better.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong><span class="highlight">PHP</span></p> <h2 id="_5-database"><a href="#_5-database" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5-database</h2> <p>you can use any sort of database(relational and noSQL) with both php and node but I can say that 99% of php developers are using some sort of relational database like mysql or postgresql and also 90% of node.js developers using noSQL databases like mongodb becuase it makes sense to use noSQL with javascript becuase it stores data in json format. but according to 2020 stackoverflow survey the  most three popular database are like this:1-mysql 2-postgresql 3-microsoft sql server. the most popular noSQL database is mongodb which is in 5th order in this list.
<strong>Winner:</strong><span class="highlight">PHP</span></p> <h2 id="_6-third-party-packages"><a href="#_6-third-party-packages" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6-third party packages</h2> <p>in node.js it is nearly impossible to build an app without using npm packages even for very simple tasks like hashing a password or validate an email you have to install third party packages but in php these kind of stuff are built in php so you don't have to install anything to hash a password or connect to a database. becuse php is specifically for back-end and it is very mature in compare to node.</p> <p><strong>Winner:</strong><span class="highlight">PHP</span></p> <h2 id="my-thoughts"><a href="#my-thoughts" class="header-anchor">#</a> my thoughts</h2> <p>I am hearing that php is dead since my first day of learning web development. but be sure that php is not dead it is very relevant very easy to use and also very easy to use integrate in html you can write your normal html and beside it you can write your php in script tag. also it is used by so many big companies like yahoo and facebook. node is also very relevent it used by companied like netflix and nasa,uber it is not as easy as php to integrate with your html but also it is not too complicated. even after reading this blog if you don't know what to learn i suggest that just watch a project-based video on youtube for both of them. then think about which one is the best for you.
hope you learned something about both of these technologies please share your comments with me in the section below ðŸ˜ƒ.
